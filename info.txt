I started working on HAT way back in 2009, and back then it was called SMoSuite/Stop Motion Suite.
Before, it just hopped from frame to frame without any transition.
Now with Vector and Angle lerp-ing, frame to frame transitions smooth into each other.

After downloading this addon, you need to bind a key to the +hat_menu console command.
You can do this by opening the console ( ~ ) and typing "bind x +hat_menu"

To select props and ragdolls to animate, open up the HAT menu and right click on a prop or ragdoll.
To do finger facial, or eye animation, you need to right click on the ragdoll's face or hands. Just right clicking on the ragdoll will not record any facial/finger poses.

You can select multiple props and ragdolls, they will all have different timelines.
